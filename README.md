### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, my name is Adan Oviedo


ðŸ’»ðŸ§¬ I'm a data-driven public health professional with over seven years of experience transforming complex datasets into actionable insights as an epidemiologist. 

ðŸ§®ðŸ”Ž I'm experienced with data management, cleaning, visualization, and analysis; leveraging tools such as SQL, Python, R, SAS, Tableau, and ArcGIS.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in extracting insights from the colossal amount of data that surrounds us. I am especially interested in anything to do with health and well-being on a societal level.
- :mosquito: I've worked professionally with various topics including human trafficking, domestic violence, malaria, staph aureus, firearm injuries and mental health conditions.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning how to refine my knowledge of programing languages. There is always a better more efficient way to get something done and it's amazing how much room for creativity there is in coding! 
- ðŸ“« Want to connect? Have any questions? You can reach me on LinkedIn anytime!
